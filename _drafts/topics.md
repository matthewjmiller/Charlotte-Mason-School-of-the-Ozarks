## Principles of our CM community

- Generous orthodoxy
	> We are a Christian community that unabashedly proclaims the Creeds but isn't afraid of generous dialogue with other views, and welcomes those who can't fully affirm our commitments 
- Belonging 
	> We study diverse materials purposely because to do otherwise deprives our children of the whole feast
	> We study the place where we live honestly 
- A living education
	> CM education isn't antiquarian or classical for the sake of classicism
- Safety
	> "We're all good people here" isn't good enough
