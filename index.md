# The Charlotte Mason School of the Ozarks

*A living education*

## Welcome

The Charlotte Mason School of the Ozarks is a Christian homeschool located in the Springfield/Branson area of Missouri. We seek to give our children *a living education* inspired by the philosophy of Charlotte Mason, for whom education is "an atmosphere, a discipline, a life."

We are actively seeking other Charlotte Mason families in the area who might be interested in cooperation and sharing resources. We'll write on this site about our experiences and the philosophy and practice of a living education.

## Who We Are

[Matt Miller](http://matt-miller.org) teaches English at College of the Ozarks, plans our curriculum, and maintains this site. In graduate school, Matt studied topics including the history of education and spiritual formation, and he brings this background to our homeschool. [Rachel](https://www.instagram.com/windfallarts/) is a mixed media artist and does most of the day-to-day instruction. We have three kids, ages 9, 7, and 4. We are members of [All Saints Anglican](https://www.allsaintsspringfield.org/) in Springfield and currently live between Reeds Spring and Branson West.

## Our Curriculum

We use [Charlotte Mason's Alveary](https://charlottemasoninstitute.org/) for most subjects and [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/) for math. Also critical to our homeschool practice is our permaculture garden/orchard and Rachel's multidisciplinary art studio.
